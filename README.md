# text-rpg

Role Playing Game (RPG) running in the console.

Under development.

You are in control of a hero in a medieval/fantasy world. The world consists of separate locations (so called rooms). While exploring the world you move between rooms, fight monsters, collect items, look for hidden treasures and gain experience. Description of locations, monsters and items are in text only. You control your hero by giving text commands.

- rooms connected via exits
- hero movement
- items, armours, weapons
- item manipulation
- worn items alter player's characteristics (ac, damage, strength, ...)

Commands:
- go ('go north', or simply 'n')
- look (at), inventory, status
- get, drop
- wear, remove
- quit
